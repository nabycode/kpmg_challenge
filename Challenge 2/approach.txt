We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP and provide a json formatted output. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Bonus Points
The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually
Hints
·         Aws Documentation (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
·         Azure Documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured)
·         Google Documentation (https://cloud.google.com/docs)




Here lets consider the cloud provider is Azure cloud.

Lets assume the resources are created using terraform.
 1. azure vm
 2. azure virtual network and subnets
 3. Load Balancers

Now to retrieve all VM information we will be using Azure Instance Metadata Service in powershell.
we can specifically retrieve any information such as networking, tags, load balancers.

and if we are using any custom data while provisioning the resources in terraform that can also be retrieved using azure IMDS.


output example file (example.json) has been attached. We are getting the metadata of our instance in json format as mentioned in the script.
