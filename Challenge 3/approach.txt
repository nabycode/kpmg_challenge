Challenge 3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a


Here, Lets consider the 3 different key inputs are a/b/c whose values are nested within the object as per the example

Now, using getValueAtPath function we can retrieve the object key value. 
And no key provided is return when we have empty path as input
object.key will return an array containing all the keys in a particular object and then try to find that key using find method.
funtion will Recursively call itself to find the key and reurn the associated value if key found else return key doesnt exist.
